The client device auth component (aws.greengrass.clientdevices.Auth) authenticates client devices and authorizes client device actions. This component allows your AWS IoT things to connect to a core device.

This component requires configuration to use. You must specify groups of client devices and the operations that each group is authorized to perform, such as to connect and communicate over MQTT. For more information, see (client device auth component documentation)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/client-device-auth-component.html].
